Project Introduction:
The Sales Forecasting for Retail Business project aims to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts future sales trends using historical sales data. Leveraging Python and powerful libraries 
such as Prophet, Scikit-learn and Pandas, this project applies time series forecasting, regression techniques and trend analysis to uncover patterns and seasonality in retail sales. The model enables 
businesses to make data-driven decisions related to inventory, marketing and resource planning. Visualizations generated using Matplotlib provide clear insights into forecast accuracy, seasonal effects and 
overall sales dynamics, making this tool an essential asset for strategic retail planning.
